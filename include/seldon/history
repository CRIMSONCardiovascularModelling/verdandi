  matrices.
- The methods 'Read' and 'Write' did not work properly under Windows because
  the streams were not opened with the option 'binary'.
- 'Matrix_Pointers::Fill(const T0& x)' could not be compiled because an
  assignment operator is not inherited in C++.

  not called.

  'Vector<Collection>::GetIndex(string)' were defined twice.
- 'MltAdd' did not accept complex vectors together with a real
  'ArrayRowSymSparse' matrix.

  which is not inherited in C++. This led to a compilation error.

  because 'realloc' may move the memory block.

  Windows because of alignment problems.
- Some 'PETSc' computation functions did not support a communicator different
  from 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.

  arguments, which could lead to compilation errors for the SWIG interface.
- In "share/SConstruct", the variable "library_path" was used to set 'CPPPATH'
  instead of 'LIBPATH'.
- "share/SConstruct" was not linking with 'petsc' and 'X11'.
- Corrected an erroneous preprocessor directive to avoid multiple inclusions
  of file "Lsqr.cxx".
- Under certain conditions, the SuperLU interface could not be compiled.

- in 'Matrix<ArrayRowComplexSparse>::AddInteractionRow(int, int, IVect,
  Vector<complex<T>, VectFull>&)': the imaginary part was not properly added.

  interface, so as to be consistent with the structure of common SuperLU
  packages.
- Renamed 'SELDON_WITH_CBLAS' to 'SELDON_WITH_BLAS'. For backward
  compatibility, 'SELDON_WITH_CBLAS' is still valid.
- Added a number of unit tests.
- The user's guide is now written in Doxygen format, which gives a better
  integration with the reference documentation.
